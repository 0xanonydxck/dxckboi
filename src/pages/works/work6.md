In my role, I closely collaborated with design teams to transform wireframes into dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces using React.js and other modern front-end tools, integrating real-time data visualization through services like TradingView. On the backend, I developed scalable systems that supported marketplace platforms, secure payment gateways, and automated Telegram bots, incorporating best practices and complex algorithms for data handling. My work also extended to data engineering, where I created efficient ETL pipelines with TimescaleDB to manage large volumes of financial data, supporting advanced investment strategies. Additionally, I managed robust DevOps practices using tools like Jenkins, Google Cloud Build, and Docker to streamline deployment processes. This technical foundation supported my work with GenAI at a Quantitative Investment Lab, providing in-depth investment analytics for gold markets.
